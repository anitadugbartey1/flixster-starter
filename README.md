### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The Pokemon example lecture realy prepared me to complete this project. I struggled with it quite a bit and had to rely on my peers for help. This time I was able to make the modal work on my own because of the lecture example. I felt a bit unprepared to complete the filter and sort because I didn't really understand the lab. I think it helped to look over the slides from class in this situation.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I would have rendered my site and attempted to make the sidebar feature. I had started trying to make the sidebar feature but gave up because it kept crashing my site. When it comes to rendering I think I will give it a try in the future when I have more time. I also would have fixed the error that opens the modal which occurs when a user selects that they watched a film.  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I noticed that my peers had very even styling in terms of the movie cards. My cards were altered to fit on multiple screens but looked crowded when the movies were displayed. I think I would have displayed less cards per line. I also had my now playing button clear movie results when used out of sequence with search. I would have fixed that bug.
